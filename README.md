## Workstyle
I thrive in an autonomous work environment, where I can work independently and efficiently. Asynchronous collaboration is my preferred mode of operation, allowing me to focus on tasks without constant context switching. I am a strong advocate for ruthless prioritization to ensure that I can deliver high-quality results without being overwhelmed by unnecessary or less-important requests.

## Team values
"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

When it comes to collaboration, I highly value objective and open-minded team members who are willing to check their egos at the door. I believe the best outcome is achieved when we work together iteratively, focusing on finding the right answer rather than on individual contributions. A collaborative work environment that fosters innovation and respects diverse perspectives is where I thrive.

## Strengths

I perform well when dropped into new or undefined situations because I can quickly zoom into details and then back out to strategic objectives. I'm a naturally curious person, so asking questions is my way of bringing form to otherwise nebulous problems or initiatives.

## ~~Weaknesses~~ Opportunities for improvement

I'm a recovering workaholic. For a long time, my profession defined who I was. Eventually, this began to chip away at my physical, emotional, and mental health. Further, it began to decay relationships with those who mean the most to me.

Each day is an effort to maintain harmony between work and life. I'm a big believer in setting boundaries and learning to say no professionally. My goal is to finish the marathon, not the sprint.

## Approach to work
I always approach my work by beginning with the end in mind. Before initiating any project or task, it is crucial to understand the objective and clearly define what success looks like. By setting clear goals and outcomes from the start, I can ensure that my efforts are aligned with the desired results. If I ask a lot of questions in the beginning, it's not because I'm challenging you.

## Perfection
While it's not an excuse to act recklessly, I believe that perfection is the enemy of progress. It's an easy trap to fall into so we need to remain conscious of the results our efforts are producing. When we find ourselves agonizing over inconsequentional language changes in release notes, it's time to click the publish button. When we find ourselves making trivial UX optimizations in an unlaunched product, it's time to launch it -- let's fill the funnel and learn now (please). 

## Radical candor
Being open to giving and receiving feedback is crucial for improving ourselves. It's the best tool for building trust within a team. I'm all about radical candor, which means I believe in giving constructive feedback right in the moment.

This is especially important in remote-first environments where it's not as easy to read a room. It's too easy for us to unintentionally miss a tell or signal that we may need to course correct.

Whether it's praise or suggestions for improvement, I'll catch up with you after an interaction that calls for clarification or feedback. I don't wait until 1:1 meetings because by then, it's old news.

## Giving (and receiving) feedback
It's not easy. Feedback can feel like conflict and we are wired to avoid conflict. To help with this, here are some tips for giving feedback to our teammates and for respectfully processing incoming feedback.

- **Assume good intent**. We are all in this together and on rare occasions do people act in malice.
- Use the SBI framework (Situation, Behaviour, Impact).
  - When you did/say ____________, I felt ______________ because ___________.
- _Thanks for the feedback._
  - Receiving feedback is not about automatically agreeing and changing what you do. All you have to do is to acknowledge and consider it, and maybe ask questions if you need clarification.

## 1:1
If you're on my team and report to me, then 1:1 meetings are _your time_. I will never force an agenda for our 1:1 meetings. If I have organizational updates to share, I will hold them until the end. Otherwise, any feedback I need to give you will be given in near real-time. I won't wait until our 1:1.

When we meet and for how long is completely up to you, my only ask is to meet no less frequently than every other week. If you have a question or want feedback, please don't wait until our next 1:1. I would prefer to help you sooner.

## Meetings
Sometimes meetings are necessary and these are the ground rules I abide by:
1. Every meeting should have a **clear purpose and agenda**, outlining the topics to be discussed and the desired outcomes. If someone receives a meeting invite and is left wondering, "What is this meeting", then we need to course-correct.
2. Meetings should be scheduled with a reasonable notice period to allow invitees to prepare and prioritize their time.
3. Invitees should be limited to only those who are essential for achieving the meeting's objectives.
4. The meeting should begin and end on time. If a meeting is scheduled for more than 30 minutes, we should closely assess if we have an attainable objective defined.

## Asynchronous communication
When it comes to communication via Slack, I've found these strategies to be most effective:
1. Whenever possible, conduct discussions and share information via public channels rather than direct messages. Depending on the sensitivity of our conversation, I might ask to take our conversation out of DM and into a public channel.
2. Use threads to keep related discussions separate and maintain clarity. We also shouldn't assume that everyone else is following our conversation, so include adequate context for those who need to catch up (or for our own future reference).
3. Avoid expecting immediate responses, and understand that asynchronous communication allows for flexibility in response times. If there is a business-critical need, then Slack isn't the appropriate channel -- I'll never fault someone for calling me.
4. Use @mentions judiciously.

## Measuring success
The question that invariably comes up is, how do we measure the success of Product Marketing? The challenge is that our preferred measures of success are usually lagging sales indicators: revenue, win rate, and pipeline. I subscribe to the idea that Product Marketing goals should closely align with those of Product. Through whatever means necessary, we should collaborate to reach mutually beneficial definitions of success for a product or objective. 

Another way to keep the focus of the Product Marketing team strategic is to consider operational metrics. For example:
1. Number of persona interviews conducted
2. Number of sales calls attended/reviewed
3. Number of win/loss interviews

These are easily measurable outcomes that will help Product Marketing teams, and the entire organization, zero-in on what will most satisfy users.

## Being "data-driven"
Being data-driven is not what a lot of people think. It doesn't mean that we need a graph for everything that can be measured. It doesn't mean that every piece of data needs to line up 100% of the time. Data is a reflection of ourselves. Sometimes it can be disorganized and incoherent, and that's okay. However, using these excuses to disregard data altogether can leave us blind.

Being a “data-driven” product marketer/product manager means that I use data to extract the signal from the noise. I use data as bread crumbs to help me find a trail and sometimes I use it to find hints for where to look next.
